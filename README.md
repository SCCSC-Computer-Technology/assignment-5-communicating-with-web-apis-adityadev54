To test out the API & Web-App.

Follow this:

 > Set either the API or Web-App to default method to run the project.
  
 > Then, run it and an option in the IDE should provide you with the terminal if not
  then try manually opening it and navigate by "cd FoodAPI" or "cd FoodWebApp" either way.

> It should then work properly and once the API is running, you can try adding the "swagger"
  at the end of the URL.
