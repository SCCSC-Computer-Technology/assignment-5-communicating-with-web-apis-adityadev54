Once I downloaded the zip folder, I was only able to see the program that I am able to run which was the "Food.sln". I did check
the "FoodWebApp" and "FoodAPI" folders and none of them have the file name .sln that let me know that I am able to open the program
and test/run it. However, once I tried to run the "Food.sln" program, it this assignment showed me a Microsoft Visual Studio message
saying, "There were build errors. Would you like to continue and run the last successful build?" and that's when I had to cut the
testing portion short because I didn't want my computer to be affect. After trying to run the program, I did notice a yellow triangle
caution(s) within the Dependencies then going to Frameworks dropdown and show both the Microsoft.AspNetCore.App and Microsoft.NETCore.App
has yellow triangle cautions.

This assignment is somewhat complete because the coding is there but is missing some pieces like API, database, and possible layout
of how the website is going to look like. However, I do see the Index of how it would look like once it ran along with Details.cshtml
and Privacy.cshtml. The program still needs work (unless I am missing something else to download) and it looks like it's making 
progress.
